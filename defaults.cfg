# Important parameters:

filterStderr = off # exclude nucs whose stderrs exceed abs(shape)*0.5+0.4
maxBackground = 0.05 # exclude nucs whose background mutation rates exceed this value

minDepth = 10 # exclude nucs whose read coverage in any condition is less than this number
              # This also occurs before any normalization.
minNormDepth = 0 # exclude nucs from calculation of normalization factor whose read
                 # depth in any condition is less than this value. This is especially
                 # useful for transcriptome datasets in which large portions of the
                 # reference sequence are uncovered. 5000 is a reasonable value.
                 
# Optional parameters (defaults are fine):
