ShapeMapper 
Release Notes:

v1.2 -  Fixed bug in pvclient.py causing some 1-nt long helices to vanish in XRNA
        files.

        Uploaded example data (bacterial ribosome and the TPP riboswitch) to the 
        Sequence Read Archive, accession SRP052065.

        Changed the EXAMPLE.cfg file to use the example data, and edited for
        clarity.

        Cleaned up figure rendering. Added a plot comparing mutation rates between
        the modified and untreated samples for each nucleotide in an RNA, with
        standard errors shown as shaded regions above and below each line.

        Reverted boxplot normalization handling of no-data points to old behavior
        (set to 0 and include in percentile calculation). This can affect the
        scale of SHAPE reactivities for small RNAs.

        Increased default Bowtie2 insert size parameter (maxInsertSize in the
        ShapeMapper config file) from 250 to 500.

        Added additional FASTA file checks: line-ending conversion,
                                            lowercase to uppercase conversion,
                                            and unknown character warning.

        Added matplotlib import and version checks.

        Removed the creation of redundant counted mutation CSV files.

Previous versions:

v1.1 -  Fixed bug causing combined FASTA files to contain one mis-named sequence,
        preventing reads aligning to this sequence from being counted. This bug
        only affected ShapeMapper runs in which a sample was aligned to multiple
        reference sequence targets (i.e. a comma-separated list of reference
        sequence names was specified in the [alignments] section of the config
        file).

        Fixed bug causing reactivity profile stage to crash for very short
        reference sequences.

        Changed reactivity profile coloring thresholds to match secondary
        structures (were 0.45 and 0.8, are now 0.4 and 0.85). This only affects
        rendered images.

        Added runtime check for the presence of compiled modules.

v1.0 - First public release
